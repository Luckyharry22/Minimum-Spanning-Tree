# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of Prim's &amp; Kruskal's algorithm, a popular algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an undirected, weighted graph. The MST is a subgraph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight while containing no cycles.
